# Project Euler solutions

URL: https://projecteuler.net/

Please do not copy my answers to solve any of the Euler solutions, the real enjoyment gained with a puzzle is that 'Aha!' moment you have when you've solved it yourself!

This folder contains the solutions for several Project Euler tasks. Project Euler is a website which stores over 500 interesting mathematical puzzles, the aim is to solve them with a programing language. 

I will be primarily completing Euler challanges in Python, Ruby, and C++. However I may use other languages from time to time.
